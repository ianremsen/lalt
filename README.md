# lalt
A lisplike to AutoHotKey script transpiler

Huge credit to http://www.buildyourownlisp.com which bootstrapped this project and supplies a significant part of the codebase.

Download
--------

Snatch the prebuilt binaries [here](https://github.com/ianremsen/lalt/releases/new).
Run in cmd (with the dll in the same directory) as 'lalt repl' to get a REPL, or 'lalt compile file' to convert a lalt file into AHK script (not implemented)

Compiling
---------

To compile you currently require Cygwin and the equivalent libreadline and libcurses.
